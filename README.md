# Front-End Development Internship Assignment

## What Was Changed (Implementation Summary)

### 1. Home Page Redesign (`src/views/Home/index.tsx` and components)
- **Hero Section:** Modern, visually striking with bold typography, clear value proposition, and animated metrics. CTAs are prominent, rounded, and visually distinct.
- **Navbar:** Sticky, glassmorphism effect, semi-transparent with blur, white text, and modern hover effects. Responsive for mobile/desktop.
- **InfoSection:** Glassmorphism, animated gradient blobs, gradient feature points, and consistent SaaS color palette.
- **FeaturesGrid & SocialProof:** Consistent styling, clean layout, and improved visual hierarchy.
- **CTAs:** Clear, bold, and consistent across the page for higher conversion.
- **Responsiveness:** All sections tested for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Accessibility:** High contrast, focus states, and semantic HTML.

### 2. Shared Routes Configuration
- Created `src/configs/routes.config/sharedRoutes.ts` for routes accessible to both authorized and unauthorized users.
- Updated route logic so new shared routes are automatically available everywhere.
- Refactored route usage in the app to avoid redundancy.

### 3. Default Path Change
- Changed the default route from `/hello` to `/` in `src/configs/app.config.ts`.
- Ensured both authorized and unauthorized users land on the redesigned home page.

## How to Test

1. **Start the app** as above.
2. **Navigate** to `/` and verify the new home page.
3. **Check navigation:** Navbar links scroll to correct sections (About, Features, FAQ, Contact).
4. **Try different devices:** Confirm responsive design and visual consistency.
5. **Test routes:** Add a new route to `sharedRoutes.ts` and verify it appears for all users.
6. **Check default path:** Visiting `/` loads the home page for any user state.
